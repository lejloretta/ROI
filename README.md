ROI contains two files that create a data visualization graph to illustrate relationship between time saved per day and money saved per year.

To use the graph:
Copy roi_1.htm and roi_1.js into a folder or on to your desktop. Both files must be stored in the same folder.
Open roi_1.htm in a web browser.
